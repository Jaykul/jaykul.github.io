This is web site is dedicated to the musings of Joel Bennett (aka Jaykul)
about technology, software, software development, the web, and the world.

Any resemblance of the views expressed and the views of my employer, my terminal, or the view out my window
are purely coincidental. The resemblance between them and my own views is non-deterministic.
The question of the existence of views in the absence of anyone to hold them is left as an exercise for the reader.

The Man of Many Hats
--------------------

> Not like the companies of worldwide fame,<br />
> Whose orchestrated clouds cover the land;<br />
> Here on our dark-themed pages shall stand<br />
> A lone individual with code in hand,<br />
> Systems and software obey their command,<br />
> DevOps Engineer.<br />

With apologies to Emma Lazarus:

The New Colossus
----------------

> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,<br />
> With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br />
> Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand<br />
> A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame<br />
> Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name<br />
> Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand<br />
> Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command<br />
> The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.<br />
> "Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she<br />
> With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,<br />
> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br />
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br />
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br />
> I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"<br />
><br />
> -- Emma Lazarus<br />

**Please Note:** I occasionally link to things I think are great.
When I do, I occasionally find a "referral code" so I can make a little cash.
I promise that I don't link to anything just because of the cash
(I wouldn't cross the street for the amount of cash those links bring in, never mind write a whole blog post),
and I promise I won't let anyone buy links in my blog content ...
but I do not promise that things I link to will stay great as time passes,
nor that you will agree with me about their greatness!
